      <h2>I'm Pissed!</h2>
      <h5>Being pissed off is better than being pissed on, Oct 20, 2020</h5>
      <div class="container text-center">

      <p>No bullcrap, I'm walking my mom across the street in the park (because let's get real, she just follows behind me) and as I'm kicking around the dead leaves, I step right in a pile of freshly peeled dog crap.  First off, I want to make it clear, I'm actually a fan of dog poop.  I enjoy sniffing it, checking out the texture, and trying to figure out what kind of dog food caused the event, but I don't enjoy being ambushed by dog poop.  My favorite thing to do is to go out of my way to kick the piles of fallen leaves around on the sidewalk.  To bury a landmine underneath one of nature's most impressive displays of seasonality really chaps my furry buns.  After tripping over that landslide of recycled kibble, I instantly realized that the butt of a Saint Bernard must have manufactured that weapon of mass destruction.  I'm pleading with the dog and owner community to please take a snow shovel with you if you're walking your beastmaster of a dog in the park.  I looked like I fell down a mud slide flume off a steep hill in the Amazon.  -Riley out.   </p>

      <h2>Coyote Ugly</h2>
      <h5>I refuse to become dinner, Oct 25, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img class="riley" src="riley10.jpg"></div>
      <p>What in the hell?  So I'm thumbing through my Facebook timeline, and I see that a coyote ran off with one of my neighbors.  He was a miniature chihuahua named Frankenberry.  Honestly, that little turd was annoying as hell, always yapping about other dogs pooping in his spot and other nonsense.  That's insane to me to know a coyote rolled him up in rice and sushied his ass.  I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  On one hand, it's a pretty horrific act, only because it could happen to me.  On the other hand, I was sick of Frank's shit.  We all know the best way to avoid being eaten by a coyote is to roll in freshly baked dog poop.  I do it everytime I walk through the park.  We've previously discussed my affection for a decent pile of crap.  The benefits of park poop are obvious, and the coyote repellent is key.  I'm voting for poop this November 3rd, to keep us safe from coyotes, and no, that's not me saying I'm voting for Biden.  --Riley out.  </p>

      <h2>I'll HotBox If I Want!</h2>
      <h5>So what, I like to cropdust my mom, so shoot me, Oct 30, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img class="riley" src="riley1.jpg"></div>
       <p>News flash: my fancy food gives me massive amounts of gas.  BFD!  Like you don't rip too.  Honestly, that Portland inspired, skinny jean wearing, hipster d-bag 
       food I eat puts about 50 cubic yards of natural gas inside my 1 cubic yard digestive system.  Sometimes I can't hold it, and I flame out, just like an oil platform
       out in the Gulf of Mexico.  I won't lie, I've been known to position my butt within danger close range of my mom's face, and I fire off a howitzer high explosive
       round.  I also laugh my fleshy sack off after watching her grimace in pain as the fumes invade her nose like noxious swamp gas.  I'm a little dude with big explosions.
       Should I ever be near an open flame?  Probably not, and I own that fact without shame.  Can I clear out a conference hall with
       a single rip?  Absolutely, and that is a skill that my mom taught me a couple years ago.  She calls it a fire drill.  Sometimes my blasts will 
       startle me and wake me up while I'm taking one of my 35 naps throughout the day.  Bottom line:  I crank gas and I
       love that about me.  I find it refreshing as hell.  --Riley out</p>

      <h2>Politics Give Me Painful Gas</h2>
      <h5>This election has me stressed the hell out, Nov 1, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img class="riley" src="riley10.jpg"></div>
      <P>What the hell is going on?  Ok, I know I'm a dog, and I know I'm supposed to think only one way.  I'm not a freakin monolith though.  I'm Riley, and I can think for
        my damn self, for the love of leg humps.  Now I can't speak for every four legged fart box, but I can definitley put down my wholegrain biscuit to speak my mind.  
        Speak! Speak! I will.  How the hell is there a guy that is living in a freakin basement, an actual contender for president of this dog loving country.  I'm a 
        mixed schnauzer, and I can put together a more coherent string of words than that assclown in the basement.  Who the hell would allow that corrupt and 
        dementia riddled assjam to hover over the critical decisions of this country.  I'm a dog, and even I know that is about as smart as cropdusting a pit bull while
        he's chewing on a T-bone.  Please, don't ruin the sweet life I have.  Keep the angry moron in the basement, and me smiling at the knowledge that there are 
        still more people that love this country than hate it.  --Riley out

      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img class="riley" src="rileymagafinal.jpg"></div>
      <P>Riley here, and I'm pissed again.  My thin black lips are quivering like a marathon runners leg after the 20th mile.  I'm all in on free speech and your 
        right to poop where I want, when I want, and how I want.  I'm done pooping with a cotton mask.  I'm a small business owner running "Riley's Wholegrain and 
        Organic Mac and Cheese and Taxi Service" here in town.  How the hell am I supposed to retire as a hardnapping turd burglar with that A-holes tax plan.  
        Eliminate the 1031 real estate option so I can't expand my business, and instead, tax the crap out of me.  No offense, but screw that unamerican buttplug.

      <h2>Even a One Eyed Puppy Could See the Voter Fraud That Took Place</h2>
      <h5>Regardless of your party, you should be pissed at how this election went down. Nov 16, 2020</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img class="riley" src="rileypillow1.jpg"></div>
      <P>So, I'm rolling out of my plush temperature controlled gel foam bed on the floor at around 4am and I rub my beady little eyes with my paws to remove the
        sleep funk.  I couldn't believe what I saw on the T.V.  In the matter of a couple hours while everyone was asleep, hundreds of thousands of votes were
        magically counted for that lying, dementia riddled, bottom of his law class Biden.  Haha, you must think 'Ol Riley is a moron.  The numbers don't come even
        close to adding up and if the shoe were on the other foot you Democrats would be screaming at the top of your lungs and rioting because of the obvious 
        fraud.  So that basement dwelling moron got more votes than Obama?  You democrats have done nothing but complain about how old white men have ruled the
        social and economic constructs of this country since its founding. So, you expect me to believe that there was so much excitement about this crusty dog turd
        that a historic voter turnout erupted to support the old white guy?  Hahah, sell that cart of horseshit to a breed with lesser intelligence; maybe a boxer
        or something.  I'm a schnauzer mix.  I've got more than 2 brain cells to rub together and this garbage stinks worse than cocker spaniel crap after it ate 
        leftover Applejacks.  Voting machine servers maintained in foreign countries, taping cardboard on windows of counting stations, multiple ballots sent to the
        same house?  Yeah, nothing to see here folks.  Starting to sound like some 1930's Germany up in here.  I want to apologize to every combat vet for having to
        witness this bullshit and I also apologize to them for every person that voted against freedom and a better way of life.  But, I hope you enjoy a solid dose
        of the 12th amendment you traitors.  Good people will prevail.  We want to work for our success.  We don't want mountains of handouts in lieu of free speech.
        Move to a communist country if that's your bag.  We've fought too hard to get were we are today.  We sure as hell didn't become the global leader because of
        handing out free shit and censoring people.  Grow up, people on the left.  P.S. notice how no trump voters rioted or burned down stores?  What was the 
        behavior of the left when Trump won?  Good vs Evil.  Adults vs Children.
