      <p>No bullcrap, I'm walking my mom across the street in the park (because let's get real, she just follows behind me) and as I'm kicking around the dead leaves, I step right in a pile of freshly peeled dog crap.  First off, I want to make it clear, I'm actually a fan of dog poop.  I enjoy sniffing it, checking out the texture, and trying to figure out what kind of dog food caused the event, but I don't enjoy being ambushed by dog poop.  My favorite thing to do is to go out of my way to kick the piles of fallen leaves around on the sidewalk.  To bury a landmine underneath one of nature's most impressive displays of seasonality really chaps my furry buns.  After tripping over that landslide of recycled kibble, I instantly realized that the butt of a Saint Bernard must have manufactured that weapon of mass destruction.  I'm pleading with the dog and owner community to please take a snow shovel with you if you're walking your beastmaster of a dog in the park.  I looked like I fell down a mud slide flume off a steep hill in the Amazon.  -Riley out.   </p>

      <h2>Coyote Ugly</h2>

      <p>What in the hell?  So I'm thumbing through my Facebook timeline, and I see that a coyote ran off with one of my neighbors.  He was a miniature chihuahua named Frankenberry.  Honestly, that little turd was annoying as hell, always yapping about other dogs pooping in his spot and other nonsense.  That's insane to me to know a coyote rolled him up in rice and sushied his ass.  I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.  On one hand, it's a pretty horrific act, only because it could happen to me.  On the other hand, I was sick of Frank's shit.  We all know the best way to avoid being eaten by a coyote is to roll in freshly baked dog poop.  I do it everytime I walk through the park.  We've previously discussed my affection for a decent pile of crap.  The benefits of park poop are obvious, and the coyote repellent is key.  I'm voting for poop this November 3rd, to keep us safe from coyotes, and no, that's not me saying I'm voting for Biden.  --Riley out.  </p>
